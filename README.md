# Rootcrit

## This is not ready for production code, at all. Use at your own risk.

Rootcrit is a Linux remote administration tool intended to run as root.

If you're not into running webservers as root (you really shouldn't due to obvious security issues), then you can expose certain functionalities using setuid more or less. The most important one is shutdown. Rootcrit is intended to allow the user to monitor a their 'top', 'who' and 'uptime' as well as shutdown the machine via their phone or any other web browser.

## Release notes

Slowly working my way toward gallery support. You can now disable the system info updates as well.

Next step: Add openpgp.js
