# Rootcrit
Rootcrit is a Linux remote administration tool intended to run as root.

If you're not into running webservers as root (you really shouldn't due to obvious security issues), then you can expose certain functionalities using setuid more or less. The most important one is shutdown. Rootcrit is intended to allow the user to monitor a their 'top', 'who' and 'uptime' as well as shutdown the machine via their phone or any other web browser.
